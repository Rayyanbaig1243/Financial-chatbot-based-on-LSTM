# Financial-chatbot-based-on-LSTM
This article introduces a professional chat robot: Doraemon, which can answer  questions related to finance. We create a financial corpus and train Doraemon to  make it a professional financial professional coach. Through Python software,  using the seq2seq method, a 3-layer long-short-term recurrent neural network is  selected as the encoder and decoder, and the framework chooses Keras. In  addition, we use another daily conversational robot built with pytorch as a  comparison. In fact, because we limit some of Doraemon's answers, the model  results are more stable than daily conversational robots. In this report, we first  introduce our timeline and reflect on two of these articles; then, introduce the  theory of the project; besides, will guide you through the steps and results of  building a financial chat robot; whatâ€™s more, suggestions for comprehensive and  further research; and finally, personal contributions and references are listed.
